     my true passion lies in making the world a better place, hence my desire to make an impact on healthcare using my knowledge about coding  
     and AI!&#8212;  <br <span

                how certain AI softwares were involved in the machines used to aid healthcare technicians, which added to my interest of AI in healthcare). I also transport patients and lab specimens.
